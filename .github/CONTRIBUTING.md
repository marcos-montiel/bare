# 🛠️ Contributing to Bare

Yo! Thanks for stopping by — whether you wanna smash bugs, build wild new features, or just vibe with the project, you're welcome here. Bare is an experimental playground, and **your ideas matter**.

---

## 📦 What Can You Contribute?

- 📜 **Language Design Ideas** — syntax tweaks, core concepts, compile-time features.
- 📝 **Docs Improvements** — clearer wording, better examples, typo fixes.
- 🛠️ **Compiler Code** — written in **Zig** for now, eventually in **Bare** itself.
- 🧪 **Tests & Tools** — test cases, small utilities, code explorers.
- 🗣️ **Discussions** — crazy concepts, weird edge cases, bold experiments.

## 📖 How to Get Started

1. **Fork the repo.**  
2. **Clone your fork.**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/marcos-montiel/bare.git

   ```
3. **Check out the open issues** or make your own!
4. **Follow the Code of Conduct.**  
   Be cool. Build cool.

## 🔨 Project Structure (for now)

- `src/` — compiler sources (written in Zig)
- `spec/` — language design notes and drafts
- `examples/` — Bare code examples
- `docs/` — documentation files

---

## 🚀 Build & Test

- To build:
  ```bash
  zig build
  ```
- To run tests:
  ```bash
  zig build test
  ```

**Note:** Until Bare can compile itself, we use **Zig** for its clarity, speed, and no-magic approach.

## 🛑 Before You PR…

- Keep it **clear and honest** — no hidden side effects, no clever hacks-for-the-sake-of-hacks.
- Follow the **Bare vibe** — clarity and control over convenience and magic.
- If it’s experimental, mark it experimental! We love weird ideas.
- Include **comments and docs** where things might get fuzzy.

# ✋ Contributing to Bare

Yo! Welcome to **Bare** — a weird little language for people who wanna make things **clear**, **explicit**, and a little chaotic (but in a good way).

We’re here to experiment. If you’ve got ideas, code, docs, memes, or weird concepts — you’re in.

## 🛠️ How to Contribute

1. **Fork it.**
2. Make a branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-idea`
3. Write your madness.
4. Run tests (if you added any)
5. Commit it: `git commit -m "Add feature: bananas compiler mode 🍌"`
6. Push it: `git push origin feature/your-idea`
7. Open a pull request and tell us what you did.

## 🎨 What You Can Work On

- Language syntax ideas  
- Compiler internals (currently Zig-based)  
- Standard library designs  
- Docs, guides, README improvements  
- Experimental `.bb` library ideas  
- `rough` LSP features  
- Build system tools (`naked` CLI improvements)
- Project templates / starter kits
- Compile-time tricks / experiments

## 📏 Code Style

- **No hidden control flow**  
- **No implicit behavior**  
- Clear, readable code over clever hacks  
- If it’s magic… kill it  
- Comments are good. Weird ASCII art is better.

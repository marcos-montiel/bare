# 📜 Bare Code of Conduct

Welcome to **Bare** — a place for curious, creative, and bold minds to build something new together. This project is about experimenting, breaking assumptions, and seeing where raw ideas can go. To keep this space fun, safe, and cool for everyone, we’ve got a few ground rules.

---

## 💎 Core Principles

- **Respect the craft, and each other.**  
  Ideas can clash — that’s good. People shouldn’t.

- **No elitism, no gatekeeping.**  
  Everyone starts somewhere. Bare is for the seasoned hacker and the curious newbie alike.

- **Feedback should build, not break.**  
  Challenge ideas, not people. Critique code, not character.

- **Stay clear, stay honest.**  
  No hidden agendas, no backdoor drama. We’re here to learn and make things fr fr.

- **Keep it weird (in a good way).**  
  Bare is experimental — if it sounds crazy but works, it belongs here.

## 🚫 What’s Not Cool

- Harassment, hate speech, or discrimination of any kind.
- Personal attacks, trolling, or being generally toxic.
- Dismissing others for not knowing something.
- Spamming, advertising irrelevant stuff, or trying to derail discussions.

## 🛠️ When in Doubt

If you’re unsure whether something crosses the line — it probably does. Ask yourself:  
> *"Would I say/do this if we were face-to-face, building this project over a cup of coffee?"*

If problems come up, ping the maintainer (that’s probably me for now 👋) and we’ll handle it quickly and fairly.

## 🤝 The Bare Vibe

This is a **workshop, not a boardroom**. Let’s build weird, cool, clean stuff, and keep it fun for everyone.
